\section{\label{sec:level1}Introduction}

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is a method that takes advantage of the magnetic moment of nuclei to characterize materials in the fields of physics and chemistry.The most widespread application of NMR is Medical Resonce Imaging (MRI) a medical imaging technique used in the diagnosis of brain tumors, stroke, and infection. MRI can also measure blood flow or detect mineral deposits in the body \cite{noauthor_neurological_nodate}.In the United States there are 34.54 MRI machines per 1,000,000 people \cite{noauthor_magnetic_nodate} so evidently the physics of NMR has major implications  beyond the field of physics.

The discovery of NMR has its origins in the quest to confirm the existence of nuclear spin theorised by Uhlenbeck,Pauli and Dirac among others in the 1920's. The weakness of nuclear magnetic moment in comparison to the electron magnetic moment was a major barrier in its experimental determination. Isidor Rabi, credited with the discovery of NMR, found the nuclear magnetic moment of Licl in 19? using molecular beam techniques \cite{rabi_new_1938} which earned him the Nobel Prize in 1944. Purcell expanded on the technique, finding the magnetic nuclear moment of a solid (parrafin) \cite{purcell_resonance_1946} in 1944. This and his work on RF fields at MIT lab led to him winning the Nobel prize in 1952 with Bloch who had also independently pursued new NMR methodologies.
Today, NMR is used in a varirty of field in physics (cite some articles?) including quantum computing where...



\section{\label{sec:level2}Experimental Setup}

The sample is placed in a probe as pictured below.


\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{images/NMr equipment schematic.png}% Here is how to import EPS art
\caption{\label{fig:schematic}Probe schematic}
\end{figure}

Consider the direction  of the applied constant magnetic field, $B_0$ to be out of the page as pictured in figure \ref{fig:schematic}.The spins precess around the direction  of the applied constant magnetic field, $B_0$.
An RF pulse is produced by the transmitter coil whose axis is perpendicular to $B_0$ (horizontal direction).

The magnetizations now precess in the x-y plane and is picked up by the receiver coil whose axis perpendicular to both the transmitter coil and $B_0$
